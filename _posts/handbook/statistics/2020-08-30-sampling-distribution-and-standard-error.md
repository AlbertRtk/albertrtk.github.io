**Sampling distribution** - the distribution formed by a sample-based statistic.

**Sampling distribution of the sample mean** - the distribution formed by arithmetic means of random samples taken from a population.

**Standard error** - the standard deviation of a sampling distribution. Defined as the standard deviation of a population divided by the square root of the sample size. 

The standard error of the mean: <br />

Often the population standard deviation is not known. The standard error of the mean can be estimated using the sample standard deviation instead: <br />
