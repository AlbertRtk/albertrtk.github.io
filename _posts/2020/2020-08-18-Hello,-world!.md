Hello, world! This is how most programming courses start, and this is how I start the blog you are reading now.
<!--more-->

The website has been created for two reasons: to share my programming projects, and to order my notes and knowledge on related topics. Therefore, at the moment of writing this post, the site is divided into two following sections:

* **Blog** - a place where I'm going to share some of my projects. Mostly focused on everyday tasks automation and the topic of data science.

* **Handbook** - a place where I will collect notes on topics I study and tutorials / solutions for challenges I've faced while working on my projects. I'll do my best to keep the information compact and clear.

I hope you will enjoy reading the Blog and will find some useful knowledge in the Handbook. Have fun!
